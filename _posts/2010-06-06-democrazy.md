网络新词：Democrazy=妄想

转歌一曲，来自墙外，保质期不详

附带YouTube网友对于GNR，对ROSE的一点点评论。

1.In my personal opinion..... Guns n Roses is nothing without slash.... but Slash is nothing without guns n roses. Don′t you agree with me there??

2.Come on Axl what the FUCK is wrong with you!Excuse my langauge but what the hell happened man I mean get off the mother FUCKING DRUGS!!!!Your old band wants you back? your NOTHING WITHOUT SLASH man!Admit it you NEED HIM and yes he needs YOU too! You had it all and then............YOU BLEW IT!!You were my FAVORITE FUCKING BAND MAN!!!!!!I cannot believe you !!!!!!!

对NO.2同学的评论深切认同。不知道这个同学去考雅思，这个感人至深的F\*CKING XXX会不会打动考官给他一个9~   至少深深的打动了我，而且找不到一个能够不用F\*CKING这个牛逼闪闪的词还能说清楚这个意思的句子...  

HE IS MY FAVOURITE FUCKING BAND MAN !!!
