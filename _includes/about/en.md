> Natt's typing place.

This is where Natt types, hosted on GitHub Pages.

Actually, my [main blog](https://blog.natt.cc) is a self-hosted WordPress blog, which far surpasses this place in terms of exquisiteness and the amount of content.

However, after accidentally encountering Markdown syntax, I was deeply impressed by its simplicity, ease of use, and clear logic. Moreover, opening an editor and writing something slightly edgy under Markdown, then committing and pushing it to GitHub, feels much better than typing potentially risky text in Shimo Docs.

Thus, this place came into being.

### Explanation

This is purely a place for writing. I will basically not include images or do any elaborate formatting. Later, I will still synchronize the content written here to my [main blog](https://blog.natt.cc).

### Acknowledgements

As a designer who stumbled into GitHub, I am deeply shocked by the open-source culture of GitHub.

Long live open source!
